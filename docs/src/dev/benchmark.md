# Benchmark with ProjectQ
[ProjectQ](https://projectq.ch) is an open source software framework for quantum computing. Here we present the single process benchmark result

```

From this benchmark, we see the performance of ProjectQ and Yao.jl are quite similar, both of them are close to the theoretical bound in performance.

ProjectQ is a state of art quantum simulator, it kept the record of 45 qubit quantum circuit simulation for several months: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01127 4
It uses parallisms like SIMD, OpenMP, MPI to speed up calculation.

ProjectQ has C++ backend, while Yao.jl uses pure julia. Yao.jl has significantly less overhead than ProjectQ, which benefits from julia’s jit and multile dispatch.

In some benchmarks, like repeated blocks, Yao.jl can perform much better, this is an algorithmic win. Thanks to julia’s multiple dispatch, we can dispatch any advanced-speciallized algortihm to push the performance for frequently used gates easily, without touching the backend!
